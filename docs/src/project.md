# Projects

## Description

Projects need to contain a couple subdirectories / files before OCTMM 
can play them. They can be created easily with the 
[create](./commands.md) command.

## Layout

`program.luau`
- Where the main user program is located.

`modules/`
- Directory that holds luau files that are intended to be used as 
utilities for the user program
