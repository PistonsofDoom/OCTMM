## Description

Overly Complicating The Music Maker (OCTMM) is an audio creation
program that allows a user to produce audio files by 
writing Lua scripts, rather than through a more 
traditional piano roll or tracker interface.

OCTMM aims to provide the user with total control, while still providing
enough utility functions to allow a user to sequence songs with
little effort. In order to succeed at both goals, OCTMM should provide:

- Low-level methods for creating new synthesizers through
digital signal processing functions.

- Methods for loading, slicing, and using sampled audio

- Utility functions for common note patterns 
(e.g. chords, major/minor progressions)

- Utility functions for sequencing sound playback
